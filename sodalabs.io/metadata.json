In contrast, the effects of changes in mineral prices vary little in ethnic diversity and institutional quality, but are non-linear and largest at relatively high prices.", "pub_online": "8 September 2020"}, {"wpn": "2020-02", "title": "Object Recognition for Economic Development from Daytime Satellite Imagery", "year": 2020, "email": "paul.raschky@monash.edu", "author": [{"name": "Klaus Ackermann", "affiliation": "Monash University, Department of Economics", "email": "paul.raschky@monash.edu"}, {"name": "Alexey Chernikov", "affiliation": "Monash University, Department of Economics", "email": "paul.raschky@monash.edu"}, {"name": "Nandini Anantharama", "affiliation": "Monash University, Department of Economics", "email": "paul.raschky@monash.edu"}, {"name": "Miethy Zaman", "affiliation": "Monash University, Department of Economics", "email": "paul.raschky@monash.edu"}, {"name": "Paul  A Raschky", "affiliation": "Monash University, Department of Economics", "email": "paul.raschky@monash.edu"}], "keyword": "satellite data, machine learning, physical capital, economic development, africa", "jel_code": "C55,O18,R11", "abstract": "Reliable data about the stock of physical capital and infrastructure in developing countries is typically very scarce. This is particular a problem for data at the subnational level where existing data is often outdated, not consistently measured or coverage is incomplete. Traditional data collection methods are time and labor-intensive costly which often prohibits developing countries from collecting this type of data. This paper proposes a novel method to extract infrastructure features from high-resolution satellite images. We collected high-resolution satellite images for 5 million 1km x 1km grid cells covering 21 African countries. We contribute to the growing body of literature in this area by training our machine learning algorithm on ground-truth data. We show that our approach strongly improves the predictive accuracy. Our methodology can build the foundation to then predict subnational indicators of economic development for areas where this data is either missing or unreliable.", "pub_online": "11 September 2020"}, {"wpn": "2020-03", "title": "Geographic Diversity in Economic Publishing", "year": 2020, "email": "simon.angus@monash.edu", "author": [{"name": "Simon D Angus", "affiliation": "Monash University, Department of Economics", "email": "simon.angus@monash.edu"}, {"name": "Kadir Atalay", "affiliation": "Monash University, Department of Economics", "email": "simon.angus@monash.edu"}, {"name": "Jonathan Newton", "affiliation": "Monash University, Department of Economics", "email": "simon.angus@monash.edu"}, {"name": "David Ubilava", "affiliation": "Monash University, Department of Economics", "email": "simon.angus@monash.edu"}], "keyword": "editorial power,  geography, diversity, economics", "jel_code": "A10, A14", "abstract": "Is the representation of editors at prestigious economics journals geographically diverse?

We find that Chinese-financed transportation projects reduce spatial concentration within\nbut not between regions.

For example, in large families, an individual must share resources with many others, but she may benefit from joint consumption. In this paper, we study individual consumption in different types of households, with a focus on family structures that are common in developing countries. Based on a collective household model, we develop a new methodology to identify the intra-household allocation of resources and the extent of consumption sharing. We apply our method to Bangladeshi and Mexican households, and find that failing to account for intra-household inequality understates child poverty in both countries. Our results suggest that standard equivalence scales overstate scale economies (and hence understate poverty). We also show that consumption estimates that ignore scale economies may lead to an overestimation of poverty rates. The extent to which this is the case depends on the degree of joint consumption and how far households are from the poverty line.

Collecting and coding 20 years of data on assassination events, we use Event Study Methodology to study how publicity of these events impact the asset prices of firms associated with abuse. We show that publicizing abuses has a significant impact on multinationals. Firm's associated with an assassination have large, negative abnormal returns following the event. We calculate a median loss in market capitalisation of over 100 million USD, ten days following violence. We highlight the role of media publicity in our results. We show negative returns from assassinations are stronger during periods of low media pressure, versus when they coincide with competing newsworthy events. As well, we argue our results are driven by events where companies are explicitly named in media publicity, using a set of placebo events where no firms were identified by news coverage. Furthermore, we reject that our results are driven by other forms of unrest and conflict.

Using textual data on media-reported events retrieved from the GDELT database, I \ffind robust evidence that governments resort to diversionary tactics in times of domestic turmoil and that such diversion takes the form of verbally aggressive foreign interactions, typically targeted at `weak' countries and countries closely linked along religious, linguistic and geographic dimensions.
